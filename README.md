## Project Overview

RouteRider is a feature-rich Android application designed to improve the way users plan and experience their daily commutes. By combining social networking with intelligent transit planning, RouteRider enables users to coordinate commutes with friends, optimize public transit routes, and discover interesting locations during downtime between activities.

## My Contributions

As a key team member on this collaborative project, I was responsible for:

-   **Frontend Development**: Built an intuitive Android application using Java and Android Studio, featuring a responsive user interface with dynamic tab navigation for a seamless user experience
-   **Google API Integration**: Implemented Google Sign-In, Maps, and Calendar APIs, allowing for personalized user experiences and location-based features
-   **Backend Architecture**: Developed a robust Node.js backend with Express and MongoDB, creating the foundation for our data-driven features
-   **Transit Optimization Algorithms**: Created algorithms for calculating optimal public transit routes based on user schedules and preferences
-   **User Matching System**: Designed and implemented the collaborative commuting feature that matches users with similar routes and schedules
-   **Points of Interest Engine**: Developed an intelligent recommendation algorithm that suggests personalized points of interest during users' free time between classes or activities
-   **Quality Assurance**: Led automated UI testing efforts using Espresso, ensuring both functional and non-functional requirements were consistently met
